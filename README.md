ClippyVS
========

The legend is back, in Visual Studio!

ClippyVS is a VS2015/2017 adornment [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ErosFratini.ClippyVS) which reacts to some actions you're making in the IDE (opening projects, saving, building, closing files, etc...).

In the future it'll have to speak with the old style message bubbles **PULL REQUESTS ARE WELCOME**
